### Limpeteer
Limpeteer is a very light weight third party app for Elite Dangerous.

It parses your journal history files and keeps track of materials and data.

Materials are sorted and categorized.

Finally it compares available materials against engineer's blueprints and shows what you can craft. If materials are missing it shows you where to get them.

### Known issues
If you dealt with materials and engineers before FD implemented the journal log the initial count will be most likely wrong and not match with what you actually have in your possession.
